=============

Provide an OWL model of the Ultrastructure ruleforms.  We generate a Java class model of this, providing the basis for a composite model framework for creating Java models of Ultrastructure.

So.  Useful.

In order to build, you'll need to sync and build the ChiralBehaviors/code-generation repository as well.
